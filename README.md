🚌 Mobility Patterns (daily transit distance)

⚡ Energy Utilization (monthly power consumption)

🌱 Dietary Preferences (meal frequency & type)

🗑️ Resource Disposal (weekly waste volume)

2. Dynamic Emission Visualization
Generates animated sunburst charts showing real-time contribution ratios of each lifestyle segment.

3. Adaptive Eco-Consultant
Proprietary AI advisor powered by Gemini:

Delivers hyper-personalized sustainability roadmaps

Generates locale-specific conservation strategies

Simulates impact scenarios through predictive modeling

4. Carbon Offset Marketplace (New!)
Integrated platform to invest in verified environmental projects proportional to your footprint.
